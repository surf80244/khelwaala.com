					<h6>GAMING ADDICTION</h6>
					<p>Gambling is a socially acceptable form of recreational activity and, in many cases, classified as a harmless pastime.

These individuals contacted by Customer Service to assess the situation and to discuss activating self-limitation and/or self-exclusion options.</p>

Having a time-out to cool off temporarily anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks is advisable to those who are predisposed to addictive behaviour, experience changes in personal circumstances or exhibit signs of mental illness.</p>
