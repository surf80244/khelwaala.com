					<h6>GAMING ADDICTION</h6>
					<p>Gambling is a socially acceptable form of recreational activity and, in many cases, classified as a harmless pastime.

The system flags clients who experience repeated losses, are facing possible financial or mental health risks or who sound distressed and/or act abusively when communicating with the Company staff. These individuals contacted by Customer Service to assess the situation and to discuss activating self-limitation and/or self-exclusion options.</p>

					<p>Clients are regularly reminded about effective limit-setting tools such as spend limit, deposit limit, session time limit and given an option to personalize a limit-setting approach. Having a time-out to cool off temporarily anywhere from 1 day to 6 weeks is advisable to those who are predisposed to addictive behaviour, experience changes in personal circumstances or exhibit signs of mental illness.</p>
